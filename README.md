This is the representation of John Glenn's orbit around Earth using Orbital Mechanics. This orbit appeared in the movie Hidden Figures. 

## Overview

This project implements a numerical orbital propagator for the classical two-body problem using Newtonian gravity. The simulation models the motion of a satellite orbiting Earth under the assumption of a central gravitational force.

The propagator integrates the equations of motion and verifies physical correctness by monitoring conserved quantities:

Specific angular momentum

Specific mechanical energy

The simulation output demonstrates stable orbital motion with conservation errors at floating-point precision levels.
